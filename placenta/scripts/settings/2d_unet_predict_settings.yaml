# 
#   root_path - Root filepath for output directories, folder will be created
#   data_vol_path - Path to the HDF5 volume to be segmented. Data should be in /data inside the file
#   model_root_path - Path to the folder containing the model file
#   model_file - Filename of the pickled 2d Unet model file. Needs to have been trained using BCE loss. For binary segmentation only
#   consensus_vals - List of consensus cutoff values for agreement between volumes 
#   e.g. if 10 is in the list a volume will be output thresholded on consensus between 10 volumes
#   normalise - If set to True, the image data will be clipped and normalised before prediction. Set to False if data is already normalised.
